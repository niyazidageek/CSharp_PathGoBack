# Path Go Back

 This is a custom algorithm that creates an opportunity to pragmatically go back in path. It is the pragmatic version of implementation of the next command in the cmd/terminal : "cd ../". 
 
 + The algorithm assigns backslashes based on the environment it works at.

 + With this algorithm, you dont have to worry about going back within the relative path anymore!
